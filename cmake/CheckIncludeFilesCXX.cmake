# - Check if the files can be included
#
# CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES_CXX(INCLUDE VARIABLE)
#
#  INCLUDE  - list of files to include
#  VARIABLE - variable to return result
#
# The following variables may be set before calling this macro to
# modify the way the check is run:
#
#  CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
#  CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
#  CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
