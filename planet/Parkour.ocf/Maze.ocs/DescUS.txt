 Heart of the Mountain

Finally, after weeks of mining you can feel that the heart of the mountain, a small deposit of magic rubies, is very close. Grandmaster Beerhardt promised a stupendous reward for whoever brings him one of those first. But he needs only one...
The tunnels around the heart of the mountain is a huge underground maze, so don't get lost!
Goal: Be the first to bring a ruby to the starting platform.
