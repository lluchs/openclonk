 Bristle Ridge

Towering piles of rock, gold and dirt floating over a bottomless abyss, covered in sharp edges, deter all but the most fiendishly clever climbers from daring to take on the Bristle Ridge. You have a shovel and a chunk of loam. Make use of these, together with the grappling hook and the wind bag, to make it to the finish-line of this nerve-wracking obstacle course.
