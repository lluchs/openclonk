 Frosty Summit

On the highest summit of the highest mountain, so it is said, the Grand Grand Father of All Clonks once resided on a throne made entirely of the finest, purest ruby of the world. The summit is now empty and covered in snow. But there are rumours that some of the gems of ancient times may still be found in this cold and hostile place.

Goal: Sell one ruby.

Hints:
- Use the grapple bow and windbag to make your way over the sky islands
- Always secure yourself with a grapple bow while handling dynamite and the Tele Glove to mine the gem.
