 Dark Castle

Oh no! King Harx, the evil tyrant, has raided a nearby village again. This madness must stop!

Build up a small stack of weapons, storm the monarch’s castle and liberate the people from the evil king. However, the castle is not easy to reach, as it is protected by sturdy rocks and hot lava lakes. And even once you got there, the sovereign has quite a few loyal servants who won’t give up their home easily.

Goal: Kill the king!

Hints:
- Rumour has it there are poisonous mushrooms in the caves below the castle
- The soldiers defending king Horax are well-equipped, but not very smart. Maybe you can trick them by sneaking up from behind
