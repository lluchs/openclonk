  Deep sea mine

You are stranded on a lonely island amidst the vast ocean. Your only hope is to build a long range communication device and call for help. But the device needs precious materials to construct which won't be easy to obtain.

Goal: Finish construction of the crystal communicator.

Hints:
-The crystal communicator needs gems for its construction. Try to find them on islands in the ocean and beneath the ocean floor.
-The ocean is deep. You need to create breating space on your way down.
-Red fish are evil!
-If coal is getting scarce, use wood to burn metal. Trees will regrow.
