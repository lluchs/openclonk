 Treasure Hunt

Deep within the legendary mountain of Clesuv, so legends are told, there is a gem of unspeakable worth. However, it was hidden millenia ago by crafty Clonks and its hiding place has been forgotten since. Can you recover the relic from its hiding place? But beware: The inside of the mountain is rough terrain and the local population does not like strangers.

Particularly courageous adventurers could also look out for gold bars hidden within and around the mountain.

Goal: Find the Gem and sell it
