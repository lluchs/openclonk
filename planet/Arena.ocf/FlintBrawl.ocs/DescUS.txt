 Flint Brawl

Fight without the usual weapons: In this scenario, everyone throws flints instead.

Goal: Last Man Standing with multiple rounds (Be the one to stay alive longest and win most rounds)

- The wind bag isn't only for getting to the high ground, but can also give an extra push to flying flints.
- The cannon is loaded with gunpowder and ready to shoot.
- Be careful, it's raining chippies and you can fall out of the bottom.
- The longer the round, the stronger the flints that spawn underground.
