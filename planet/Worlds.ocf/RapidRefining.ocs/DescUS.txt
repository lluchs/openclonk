Rapid Refining

An apparently infinite oil well is hidden deep inside a cave. Connect the well to the refinery drain outside of the cave using pumps and supply the refinery. 

Goal: Pump oil.

Hints:
- Do not set oil on fire, it will burn for a long time.
- You can connect multiple pipes to the refinery drain.
