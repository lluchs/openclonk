Krakatoa's Krach

Dense fog, scorching heat, unbearable humidity, fizzling meteors, trembling earth... Still the promise of tremendous wealth and imperishable fame attracts dozens of fortune-hunters to this unforgiving place. You make first steps into the crater undaunted, but wince as the earth trembles. In front of you, a piece of rock crumbles into the lava, and is instantly engulfed. You quickly gather yourself and climb onto a higher ledge. Still determined, you begin to execute the plans made beforehand. There is no time to lose, no margin for error, and any misstep will be fatal. But you are confident that your dedication, drive and skill will result success. It's all up to you!
