Acid gold mine

A gold mine located in some very hostile environment.

Goal: Gain wealth.

Hints:
- At the beginning, you should dig down to build an underground base.
- Use metal bridges to secure the cave against acid floodings.
- There is an underground spot into which you can cram two windmills. Use it!
