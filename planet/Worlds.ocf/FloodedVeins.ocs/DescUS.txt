Flooded Veins

You stumble upon an abandoned settlement beneath the Forest of Orgos in your quest for more gold. Legends tell a story of even more  valuable materials named gems which may be found here. Might this abandoned settlement be a failed attempt to find these gems? Set up an expedition to explore the flooded caves around and to discover possible gem veins.

Goal: Sell gems.

Hints:
- The flooded caves may be drained using pumps, you can get rid off the excess water where you entered the cave.
- The large mushrooms can be chopped down for wood.
