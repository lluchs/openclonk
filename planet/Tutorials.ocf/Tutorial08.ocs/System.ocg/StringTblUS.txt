# Dialogue: Chief
DlgChiefHello=Hello I am chief of operations of the mines below. But we had a disaster and our dike protecting us from the sea broke, and now the mine is flooded.
DlgChiefReply=Oh that is terrible, I came here to buy some metal from you.
DlgChiefNoMetal=Well, we don't have any metal available as we can't transport it out of the mine. My miners are even stuck below.
DlgChiefHelp=Well, what if I help you get the metal out of the mine?
DlgChiefAppreciation=That would be wonderful! You can use this pump I have just built, unfortunately it is not strong enough to empty the sea here, but it may be of help.
DlgChiefReward=Can I get some reward for this?
DlgChiefMetal=Yes, of course. The metal you can get to the surface you may keep, if you tell me how you did it!
DlgChiefLorry=I got the lorry with metal up to the surface!
DlgChiefKeepLorry=That's great, now we can use your method to keep excavating the mine! You may keep the lorry and its contents.
DlgChiefReally=You can really keep the lorry and the metal.
DlgChiefLorryUp=Almost there! Get the lorry up to the surface by calling the elevator.
